# The Silent Voice: Sign Language Assistance System  

## 📌 Overview  
**The Silent Voice** is a two-way sign language assistance system that facilitates communication between sign language users and non-signers. It features:  
- **Sign-to-Text/Speech**: Recognizes signs (ASL/NSL) using CNN and converts them to text/speech.  
- **Text/Speech-to-Sign**: Translates user input (text/speech) into sign language videos via Bag of Words (BoW).
